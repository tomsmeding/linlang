# linlang

This is an implementation of a small language with uniqueness types, inspired
by Philip Wadler's _Linear types can change the world!_ ([link][wadler]). It
was slightly modified to match more closely with the syntax of MinHS in the
_Concepts of Programming Language Design_ course taught by Gabriele Keller at
Utrecht University.

The `let!` syntax from Wadler's paper is not supported because I think its
typing rule is overly crude.
